    "# Introduction and Background\n",
    "Almost everyone uses some sort of online social media. For many of us, social media has become one of the primary ways in which we engage with the news, seek opportunities, and consume information. Social media platforms have a difficult role to play -- there is far too much information out there for any one individual to navigate individually, so platforms must filter information for us. To do so at scale, they must design algorithms that intelligently support and direct our attention. But the design of attentional-management systems has the potential to dramatically impact what people know and beleive!       \n",
    "\n",
    "## Big Questions \n",
    "* Do social media algorithms actually influence the things that people beleive? Can they influence democratic processes?\n",
    "* Should content selection algorithms be regulated?\n",
    "* Should they be transparent?\n",
    "* Who should decide what counts as misinformation and disinformation, and what should platforms do in response?\n",
    "* how do the design characteristics of a system impact information consumption among users?\n",
    "* How can we address this with data analysis?\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Methods\n",
    "Understanding the impacts of algorithmic mediation of human interactions is an inherently difficult problem. In many circumstances, even if you know the algorithm completely, it's consequences cannot be straight-forwardly predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "A range of methods have been developed to try to make inferences about the algorithms underpinning social media platforms, their impacts on the information that is available to people, and even their impacts on downstream behavioral outcomes and decisions. Here are just a few examples below, selected somewhat hap-hzardly from a large research field.\n",
