    "## Prevelance of LLMs\n",
    "ChatGPT needs no introduction. It is used by more than 500 million people and almost all university students use some sort of AI system to support their work now. A [recent OpenAI and NBER analysis](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/) of 150 million ChatGPT conversations shows that people are increasingly using ChatGPT for personal as well as work-related issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Information consumption from AI systems\n",
    "Conversational AI models are becoming a source of information and understanding comparable to search engines and social media platforms. Where is the information coming from? What information is being prioritized? What are the algorithms that determine the information a person is offered and how it is presented? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Familiar Questions\n",
    "Questions such as these are analogous to the questions we have alrready discussed around social media platforms, yet their answers are likely to be even more complicated. Even the designers of conversational AI systems don't fully understand the structure and properties of the underlying algorithms that pre-trained AI systems have acquired. Currently, empirical experimentation is the primary way to gain insights into these systems and their potential impacts on information consumption and propogation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions with who/what?\n",
    "While it may not feel like you are interacting with other people when using a conversational AI system, there is a sense in which this is what you are doing. AI systems are trained on human traces of knowledge, including social media data and other products of human interaction and human intelligence. Yet they are also more than a search algorithm -- the properties of their underlying models can lead to novel information, or at least novel presentations of existing information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods for Evaluation\n",
    "Understanding the capabilities and limitations of modern AI systems is a pressing challenge for many companies, with broad implications for society and deep connections to social science, especially cognitive science and psychology. While engineeers who build AI systems understand the architecture of their models and the learning algorithms used to train them (and understand some of the data), even full knowledge of these features does not lead to an understanding of the behavioral capabilities of the resulting trained systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, companies and outside parties alike rely on methods for evaluation of model behavior. Typical methods for evaluation assess performance on static benchmark datasets, such as benchmark problems in math, reasoning, coding, and many other domains. More recently, evaluation methods have begun to include interactive settings, where models are assessed through features of their interactions with human users. \n",

    "* What were some secondary findings?\n",
    "* What were the backfire reactions?\n",
    "* Does Personalized AI debates pursauade more effectively on all topics?\n",
    "* Is the debate format a good format? Does this limit the study in specific ways?\n",
    "* Participants were randomly assigned to pro or con positions. Does this bias or limit the study in any particular ways?\n",
    "* Is demographic information sufficient for personalization? Could a person exploit this meaningfully?\n",
    "* Why were odds ratios used?\n",
    "* AI debaters tended to use more logical and analogical reasoning, whereas people used similarity, support, trust, and storytelling. Anything to discuss here?\n",
    "* Humans identified AI opponents as AI, but failed to identify human opponents. Why? Does this tell us something interesting?\n",

    "## General discussion and reflection\n",
    "* Does this research change how you view AI systems?\n",
    "* Do you worry about pursuasation by AI systems? \n",
    "* Does this research methodology capture what it claims to capture? Can you think of better ways to examine the question of AI capabilities?\n",
    "* Is comparison to human pursuasion a reasonable benchmark?\n",
    "* Could the designers of GPT4 know the outcome of this study before it was conducted?\n",
    "* How do you think AI systems will influence real world conversations about important topics?\n",
    "* Do you think misinformation is likely to be a big concern around AI systems in the same way as it was on social media platforms?\n",
