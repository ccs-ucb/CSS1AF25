    "\n",
    "In [last week's class](https://github.com/ccs-ucb/CSS1AF25/blob/main/notebooks/notebook-2-social-media-tiktok.ipynb) we discussed the challenges assosciated with accessing data from modern social media platforms, and evaluating aspects of their content prioritization algorithms. We explored the use of external audits through experimentation with sock puppet accounts, by diving into a [recent study of TikTok](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20231v1), and complications around use of (even publicly-available) data retreived from social media platforms, by diving into [Reddit's terms of service for research practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/1co0xnu/sharing_our_public_content_policy_and_a_new/) and the underlying motivations for these changes.\n",

    "After our discussion, I will introduce Bluesky, a relatively recent addition to the social media landscape notable for its open, distributed design protocols and radically open data acess policies. Most of today's class will be a hands-on lab session in which we get to know [Bluesky's public API](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference) and how to interact with it via http requests in Python.  \n",

    "Bluesky ([https://bsky.app/](https://bsky.app/)) is a decentralized social media platform built around principles of openness. It was initially created by a research team within Twitter, as a way to establish whether in theory, a social media platform with the qualities of Twitter could be run in a decentralized fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform is built on an open-source model called the [AT protocol](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto). In this model, every user can own their data and choose what algorithms select the contents of their feed (more information here: [https://bsky.social/about]https://bsky.social/about). In principle, the entire platform can function in a decentralized way where no one entity controls data, algorithm, or user expereince. In practice, the current platform depends heavily on services provided by [Bluesky Social](https://bsky.social/about).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this model, each user's data is publicly available. It can be a surprise to learn that *everything* you do on Bluesky is publically available -- the people you follow, the people you block or mute, the things you like and repond to, and all of your profile information. There are clear benefits to this openness, but are there also potentially challenging consequences? Here is [an interesting thread on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/1h1pfwh/alpin_releasing_a_dataset_of_two_million_bluesky/) around the ethics of collecting data at scale from Bluesky to train machine learning models.
